	<h2>Preamble</h2>
	
Here I list some open problems that have arisen from my research (with various coauthors, of course). Probably all the good questions were already asked before, and in such cases I try to give a reference. Do tell me if attributions are missing.
<br><br>
For now, I do not cite my own papers where the questions arose, nor explain the context, unless the question uses nonstandard terminology that is only explained in the paper (and even then, not necessarily). Hopefully this improves later. The questions have a randomly assigned id code, as I don't want to be married to a fixed ordering (because the categorization is currently rather bad). I may clarify a question without changing the id code, if I believe the content stays the exact same.
<br><br>
If you feel some question is not stated precisely enough, feel free to send me an email and I will add details. If you solve a problem, I'll be very interested in knowing. Many pairs of questions of course have substantial overlap or direct implications between them. I believe most of these questions are hard. There are a few where I don't remember why they were supposed to be hard, and there are a few I feel should be easy. This is not a fixed list, and I will keep updating it as I stumble into new or old problems.
<br><br>
Have fun.

<h2> Definitions </h2>

Definitions are mostly included in the questions, or just in the cited reference, but a few are listed here.
<br><br>
A (\(G\)-)<em>subshift</em> is a topologically closed \(G\)-invariant subset of \(A^G\) under \(G\)-translations, where \(A\) is a finite discrete alphabet. The full system \(A^G\) is the <em>full shift</em>. An <em>SFT</em> is a subshift defined by taking the points of the full shift whose orbit never enters a particular clopen set. We have natural analogs of these on monoids, in particular on \(\mathbb{N}\) (the shift may or may not be required to be surjective, but this shouldn't matter in the questions).
<br><br>
A <em>morphism</em> between subshifts is a continuous shift-commuting map. A <em>factor map</em> is a surjective morphisms, and an <em>embedding</em> is an injective one. A <em>factor</em> of a subshift is an image of it in a factor map. These terms also extend to other dynamical systems in an obvious way. A factor of an SFT is called <em>sofic</em>.
<br><br>
When \(X\) is a subshift, \(\mathrm{Aut}(X)\) refers to the group of self-homeomorphisms of \(X\)
that commute with the shift maps on \(X\), i.e. its automorphisms. Write \(\mathrm{Aut}_n = \mathrm{Aut}(\{0,1,...,n-1\}^{\mathbb{Z}})\)
for short. If \(G\) is a group, a subgroup \(H \leq G\) is <em>universal</em>
if \(G \leq H\) (up to isomorphism).
<br><br>
A <em>pattern</em> is \(P \in A^D\) for (by default finite) \(D \subset G\), and the corresponding <em>cylinder</em> is \([P] = \{x \in A^G \;|\; x|D = P\}\), where \(G, A\) are understood from context.
<br><br>
Let \( G \) be a countably infinite group, \( A \) a finite alphabet with \( 0 \in A \). We
have a continuous action \(G \curvearrowright A^G\) on the Cantor space \(A^G\) by \(gx_h = x_{g^{-1}h}\).
Say \(G\) is <em>nilrigid</em> if the following holds
Whenever a continuous function \(f : A^G \to A^G\) commutes with the \(G\)-action and satisfies \(\forall x \in A^G: f^n(x) \overset{n \rightarrow \infty}\longrightarrow 0^G\) where \(0^G \in A^G\) is the unique element of \(\{0\}^G\), we also have \( f^n(A^G) \overset{n \rightarrow \infty}\longrightarrow \{0^G\}. \)
<br><br>
Let \(G\) be a finitely-generated group with decidable word problem. We say \(G\) is <em>self-simulable</em> if all \(G\)-subshifts with a decidable language of defining forbidden patterns (a.k.a. \(\Pi^0_1\) or <em>effective</em> subshift) is sofic.
<br><br>
If \(H \leq G\) are groups, and \(X\) is a \(G\)-subshift, the <em>\(H\)-trace</em> of \(X\) is just \(\{x|_H \;|\; x \in X\}\). For a group \(G\) clear from context, the <em>sunny-side-up</em> is the subshift \(\{x \in \{0,1\}^G \;|\; \sum x \leq 1\}\). If \(G\) is a group, \(D \subset G\) is finite and \(P \in A^D\), then we write
\([P] = \{x \in A^G \;|\; x|_D = P\}\). If \(H \leq G\) and \(X \subset A^H\) is a subshift, the <em>free extension</em> (or <em>induction</em>) is the subshift of \(A^G\) with the same forbidden patterns as \(X\). This idea extends naturally to other dynamical systems, by representing systems over a Cantor space alphabet.
<br><br>
If P is a property of configurations in \(A^G\), a configuration \(x \in A^G\) is <em>asymptotically P</em>
if there is a configuration \(y \in A^G\) with property P such that \(\{g \in G \;|\; x_g \neq y_g\}\)
is finite. If \(G = \mathbb{Z}^d\) a configuration is <em>semilinear</em> if for each \(a \in A\),
\(\{\vec{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^d \;|\; x_{\vec{v}} = a\}\)
is semilinear (definable in Presburger arithmetic). A configuration
\(x \in A^G\) is <em>periodic</em> if \(\{g \in G \;|\; g\cdot x = x\}\)
is a finite index subgroup of \(G\). If we have singled out a zero symbol \(0 \in A\) (usually meaning
literally \(0 \in A\)), then the <em>support</em> of \(x \in A^G\) is \(\{g \in G \;|\; x_g \neq 0\}\).
In the same situation, \(x \in A^G\) is <em>homoclinic</em> if \(\{g \in G \;|\; x_g \neq 0\}\) is finite, in other words \(x\) is asymptotically (all-)zero.

<li> (Q38471943) Is there a universal algebraic variety \(V\) (with finitely many operations, and preferably as "natural" as possible) which is not shallow, yet all internal \(V\)-algebras in the category of subshifts on \(\mathbb{Z}\) can be cellwised. <a href="#SaTo21">[Salo-Törmä, 2021]</a>

<li> (Q84253285) Let \(X\) be a compact metric space. Let \(G \) be a group acting on \(X\), and \(H\) a semigroup acting on \(X\). Suppose the actions commute, \(H\) acts expansively, and \(G\) acts faithfully with all points periodic. Is \(G\) necessarily finite?

<li> (Q83394179\(n\)) Fill the \(n\)th empty square in Table 1 in <a href="#SaTo15">[Salo-Törmä, 2015]</a>.

<li> (Q62356761) Are all sofic \(\mathbb{Z}\)-shifts \(X\) realizable through surjectivity of nonuniform cellular automata, in the sense that we can find a set of local rules such that the set of sequences over these rules which give a surjective map is exactly \(X\) (up to renaming symbols)?

<li> (Q80139192) Is the smallest subshift whose language contains the regular language \(0^*1^* + 1^*0^*\) realizable in the previous sense?

<li> (Q96181689) Is the smallest subshift whose language contains the regular language \((00 + 01)^*\) realizable in the previous sense?

<li> (Q09685989) Which subshifts are winning shifts of mixing \(\mathbb{N}\)-SFTs, in the sense of <a href="#SaTo14">[Salo-Törmä, 2014]</a>?

<li> (Q68900134) Let \(X = \{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}\) be Cantor space. We construct another topological space by taking the clopen sets of \(X\) as points \(Y\), and for each \(x \in X\) we take \([x] = \{y \in Y \;|\; x \in y\}\) and the complements of such sets as a subbasis for a topology. Is this space definable by topological properties, and is it somehow "dual" to Cantor space?

<li> (Q46864016) Let \(X\) be an internal Jónsson-Tarski algebra in the category of subshifts over a group \(G\) (with block maps as morphisms). Suppose \(G\) has exponential growth. Is  \(X\) necessarily the one-point subshift?

<li> (Q61373495) Is there a modular lattice subshift on \(\mathbb{Z}\) which is of finite type and mixing, and cannot be conjugated to a subshift \( Y \subset B^{\mathbb{Z}} \) where \(B\) is a modular lattice, so that the operations of \(X\) correspond to the cellwise operations of \(Y\).

<li> (Q05365023) Is the picture language class UFA <a href="#KaSa11">[Kari-Salo, 2011]</a> closed under union?

<li> (Q48675137) Are the picture language classes NFA and FNFA <a href="#KaSa11">[Kari-Salo, 2011]</a> equal in dimension three and higher?

<li> (Q13409404) Characterize the subsets \(D \subset \mathbb{Z}^2\) such that for \(X\) the Ledrappier subshift we have \(X|D = \{0,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}^2}\).

<li> (Q45457810\(S\)) Here \(S \Subset \mathbb{Z}^2\) is finite. Characterize the subsets \(D \subset \mathbb{Z}^2\) such that for all TEP subshifts \(X\) in the sense of <a href="#Sa22">[Salo, 2022]</a>, over any alphabet \(A\), we have \(X|D = A^{\mathbb{Z}^2}\).

<li> (Q16620019) Compile a list of open problems in symbolic dynamics. (Existing lists are missing many important problems.)
