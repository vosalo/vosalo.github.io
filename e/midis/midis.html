<p> I have made a huge amount of midi/guitar pro songs. I list some here. Most are in the gp4 format. At least Guitar Pro 5 opens them perfectly. MuseScore opens them with some instrument problems, like acoustic guitars in place of distortion guitars. Sometimes that works too. </p>

<ul>
<li> I planned a full album for hereford (before 2006, but don't know exactly when), but we learned only Not afraid before we stopped playing. List of songs below with links to gp4s, and some commentary written in 2023. Maybe I'll play these myself at some point, in some form. Listening to these in 2023, it's a little depressing and funny to see how little I've evolved musically. :) Vocal tracks are mostly not written. I remember at least some of the melodies, but I don't really feel like adding them now. Some of the songs are way too long for no reason. Unlike my songs nowadays which are just as long for surely great reasons. The album would've also had the two demo songs, a very nice song composed by our guitarist Ilmari, and I had lyrics for a few more songs that I never wrote score for.
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="midis/Chromatic Vision.gp4">Chromatic vision</a> (5:00). I wrote this immediately after downloading Guitar Pro, just to learn how it works. 
	<li> <a href="midis/Essence Of Truth.gp4">Essence of Truth</a> (6:10)
	<li> <a href="midis/Fake Man.gp4">Fake Man<a> (7:30)
	<li> <a href="midis/Hammered Down.gp4">Hammered Down<a> (3min 40s). This one was not so serious, I tried to write something like Killswitch Engage (which I thought kind of sucked back then, and I didn't get it at all). People usually think this is the best one.
	<li> <a href="midis/Hate.gp4">Hate</a> (3:08) IIRC I tried to write the heaviest song ever.
	<li> <a href="midis/Impossible.gp4">Impossible</a> (3:20)
	<li> <a href="midis/Kohtalon Kynsi.gp4">Kohtalon Kynsi</a> (5:10) This was inspired by the band Ajattara.
	<li> <a href="midis/Love Is Contagious.gp4">Love Is Contagious</a> (4:25)
	<li> <a href="midis/Love The Cold.gp4">Love The Cold</a> (5:40)
	<li> <a href="midis/My Obituary.gp4">My Obituary</a> (5:50) in flames
	<li> <a href="midis/My Zodiac.gp4">My Zodiac</a> (4:10) Tried to make some sort of classical-style. The first riffs were supposed to be super difficult, now I find them quite playable.
	<li> <a href="midis/Not Afraid.gp4">Not Afraid</a> (9:55) This one we actually played with the band.
	<li> <a href="midis/Rinse.gp4">Rinse</a> (4:00)
	<li> <a href="midis/The Long Story.gp4">The Long Story</a> (11:00)
	<li> <a href="midis/Trying To Be Mayhem.gp4">Trying to be Mayhem</a> (5:50) I suppose this was inspired by listening to Mayhem, though I doubt it sounds very similar. I don't actually remember what Mayhem sounds like, haven't listened to it in at least a decade.
	<li> <a href="midis/Wrath.gp4">Wrath</a> (7:45)
	</ul>

<li> <a href="midis/lastsandwich.mid">The Last Sandwich</a> (from 2011) My plan was to put all in into an amazing half-an-hour song. I think I spent several months not working on any music other than this song. I ended up with about 12 minutes of awesome riffs, with very little cohesion. But seen as such, I think it's pretty good. I never wrote drums for it, Ilmari wrote the short drum part in the beginning. It also ends a little prematurely, maybe it's meant to. Would be cool to play this too.
