	<h2>Closed problems</h2>
	
	<p>
	Here I list "open problems" that "I" have "solved".<sup>1</sup>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I usually work on my own problems rather than other people's, so this list is not necessarily representative of my research. Nevertheless I found it interesting to compile.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you notice a mistake on this list (or in one of the results!), you can contact me through email. I know the reference list has very bad formatting, sorry about that.

	Latest update: July 10th, 2025.

		<li> There exists a non-finitely generated group which admits a minimal sofic shift.
			<ul>
			<li> asked in <a href="#DoMeTs25">[Doucha-Melleray-Tsankov, 2025]</a>, Question 7.18 (ii).
			<li> I prove this in <a href="#Sa25a">[Salo, 2025a]</a>.
			</ul>
	
		<li> The sensitivity of one-dimensional cellular automata is \(\Pi^0_2\)-complete.
			<ul>
			<li> asked in <a href="#SaTh11">[Sablik-Theyssier, 2011]</a>: "what is the exact complexity of \(\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{ens}}\) in 1D? is it \(\Pi_2\)-complete or only at level 1 of the arithmetical hierarchy?".
			<li> We prove this with Tom Favereau in <a href="https://villesalo.com/article/DCoSoCA.pdf">our recent preprint</a>.
			</ul>
		
		<li> The sensitivity of two- and higher-dimensional cellular automata is \(\Sigma^0_3\)-complete.
			<ul>
			<li> asked in <a href="#SaTh11">[Sablik-Theyssier, 2011]</a>: "we believe that the set \(\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{ens}}\) is in the arithmetical hierarchy for any dimension, but we have no proof yet starting from dimension 2."
			<li> We prove this with Tom Favereau in <a href="https://villesalo.com/article/DCoSoCA.pdf">our recent preprint</a>.
			<li> Actually I would say this problem is \(\Sigma^0_3\) by definition, and this technically already answers their question. However, one can read the question as asking about the exact complexity as well, and this (\(\Sigma^0_3\)-hardness) is our main result.
			</ul>
	
		<li> \(\mathrm{Aut}(\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}^k})\) does not embed in \(\mathrm{Aut}(\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}^d})\) if \(k > d\).
			<ul>
			<li> Hochman asked the following in the conference "Current Trends in Dynamical Systems and the Mathematical Legacy of Rufus Bowen", see the <a href="https://pims.math.ca/files/shortsessionv3.pdf">Symbolic Topology Session</a>: "\( k < d \), the automorphism group of a full \(\mathbb{Z}^k\)-shift on two symbols embeds as a subgroup in the automorphism group of a full \(\mathbb{Z^d}\)-shift on two symbols. Is there an embedding if \(k > d\)?" Our result gives a negative answer.
			<li> Hochman also asked in <a href="#Ho10">[Hochman, 2010]</a> the following: "Another basic question is whether the automorphism group of the full shift on two symbols in dimension \(d > 1\) can be embedded in any of the automorphism groups of a lower-dimensional SFT.". This we do not really solve, but we address interesting cases of it.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa25">[Salo, 2025]</a>
			<li> Hochman officially asked 5 questions in this session, and I remember, specifically because the first question is this one, as summarizing Hochman's session as "his usual impossible questions". So quite exciting to solve it now. (Though I already previously solved question 5 from this list, and also the pivot problem from his other session.)
			</ul>

		<li> \(\mathrm{Aut}(\{0,1\}^{F_2})\) does not embed in \(\mathrm{Aut}(\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}})\).
			<ul>
			<li> Question 7.6 of <a href="#CyKrSc24">[Barbieri-Carrasco-Vargas-Rivera-Burgos, 2025]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa25">[Salo, 2025]</a>
			</ul>
	
		<li> Finitary Ryan's theorems can be proved on groups.
			<ul>
			<li> Question 7.2 of <a href="#BaCaRi25">[Barbieri-Carrasco-Vargas-Rivera-Burgos, 2025]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaSc25">[Salo-Schmieding, 2025]</a>
			<li> Note that the question is quite open-ended. On general groups we prove it just for some full shifts, and for \(\mathbb{Z}^d\) for contractible SFTs (with a fixed point).
			</ul>

		<li> Every finitely-generated residually finite group admits a CAM system.
			<ul>
			<li> F.g. case of Conjecture 6.4 of <a href="#CyKrSc24">[Cyr-Kra-Schmieding, 2024]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa24">[Salo, 2024]</a>
			<li> Note that the non-f.g. case is also interesting -- perhaps even more interesting. I don't see why f.g. would be essential in such a construction, but I do use it at one point.
			</ul>
	
		<li> There is a nonexpansive CAM system on \(\mathbb{Z}\).
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in Question 6.5 of <a href="#CyKrSc24">[Cyr-Kra-Schmieding, 2024]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa24">[Salo, 2024]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: CAM subshifts are easy to make: do the usual recursive construction, but at every step, use large periodic areas of all previous levels. Now just take an abstract quotient to kill expansivity (quotient by any non-SFT equivalence relation).
			</ul>
	
		<li> The lamplighter group \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{Z}\) admits a strongly aperiodic subshift of finite type.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in <a href="#Co20">[Cohen, 2020]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#BaSa24">[Bartholdi-Salo, 2024]</a>
			<li> We develop an extensive simulation theory, which proves much more than this, in particular we also solve the three questions below. The lamplighter group was the primary candidate for behavior between free groups and a plane (but we show that in most respects it behaves like the plane). This group did not allow for directly using any existing techniques, as it does not contain any coarsely embedded plane (Euclidean or hyperbolic).
			</ul>
			
		<li> The lamplighter group \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{Z}\) has undecidable domino problem.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in <a href="#Co20">[Cohen, 2020]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#BaSa24">[Bartholdi-Salo, 2024]</a>
			</ul>
			
		<li> The entropies of SFTs on \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{Z}\) are precisely the upper semicomputable numbers.
			<ul>
			<li> Question 6.3 in <a href="#Ba21">[Barbieri, 2021]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#BaSa24">[Bartholdi-Salo, 2024]</a>
			</ul>
			
		<li> The entropies of SFTs on \(BS(1, 2)\) are precisely the upper semicomputable numbers.
			<ul>
			<li> Question 6.2 in <a href="#Ba21">[Barbieri, 2021]</a> (Barbieri asks about \(BS(1, n)\), and we concentrate on \(n = 2\), but the same idea works directly.)
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#BaSa24">[Bartholdi-Salo, 2024]</a>
			<li> This group is intersimulable with the lamplighter group, in the sense of our previous paper, so we extract this from the previous theorem.	
			</ul>
	
		<li> The group \(\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}\) embeds in the automorphism group of a full shift. In particular, there is a finitely-generated torsion free group with infinite cohomological dimension that embeds in the automorphism group of a full shift.
			<ul>
			<li> Implicitly asked in <a href="#KiRo90">[Kim-Roush, 1990]</a>.
			<li> Explicitly asked (together with embeddability of \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr (\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{Z})\), which we solve in this same paper) in <a href="#Sa20b">[Salo, 2020b]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa23">[Salo, 2023]</a>
			</ul>
		<li> There is a distortion element in the automorphism group of the full shift.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked by several people in private communication, in writing in <a href="#CyFrKrPe18">[Cyr-Franks-Kra-Petite, 2018]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#CaSa22">[Callard-Salo, 2022]</a>
<li> Additional information: Distortion is quasi-exponential, i.e. word norm of the element grows polylogarithmically. The element is basically the SMART machine. The question was open for arbitrary subshifts.
			</ul>
		<li> The image of B3/S23 contains zero-homoclinics that are not in the image of zero-homoclinics.
			<ul> <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3180&start=125#p140453">ConwayLife forum post announcement (by myself and Ilkka Törmä).</a>
			<li> This question was on the open problems list distributed on the Conwaylife Discord server, seen January 14th, 2022.
			</ul>
		<li> B3/S23 admits a backwards-invariant (non-full) cylinder containing a point that is spatially zero-homoclinic and temporally fixed.
			<ul> <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3180&p=139666#p140258">ConwayLife forum post announcement (by myself and Ilkka Törmä).</a>
			<li> A weaker version of this problem was asked by Conway in <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Lifeline_Volume_6">Lifeline Volume 6</a>, and it was later strengthened to the modern version in a 1992 email by Conway and further clarified by contemporary Life enthusiasts.
			<li> Out of all my results, this raised by far the most interest (as far as I know). So much so that they tried to add it to <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GameofLife.html">Game of Life page on MathWorld</a>.
			</ul>
		<li> B3/S23 never reaches its limit set.
			<ul> <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3180&p=139666#p139854">ConwayLife forum post announcement (by myself and Ilkka Törmä).</a>
			<li> This was sort of implicitly open, see <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Grandfather_problem#Next_levels">this Wiki page</a>. Conway offered 50 dollars for showing \(g^2(X)\) is not the limit set; this was open until 2016 when mtve showed that even \(g^4(X)\) is not the limit set.
			</ul>
		<li> Two mixing one-dimensional SFTs are conjugate if and only if they are conjugate without their periodic points.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#Ho13">[Hochman, 2013]</a>
			<li> Repeated in: <a href="#Ho19">[Hochman, 2019]</a> and <a href="#BoBuMc15">[Boyle-Buzzi-McGoff, 2015]</a>, also Hochman's question 5 in the conference "Current Trends in Dynamical Systems and the Mathematical Legacy of Rufus Bowen" <a href="https://pims.math.ca/files/shortsessionv3.pdf">Symbolic Topology Session</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa21b">[Salo, 2021b]</a>
			</ul>
		<li> There is a group whose effective subshifts are sofic.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#AuBaSa17">[Aubrun-Barbieri-Sablik, 2017]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#BaSaSa21">[Barbieri-Sablik-Salo, 2021]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: In \(F_2\) you can find disjoint paths starting from each group element. So in \( F_2 \times F_2 \) you can have a separate grid for each group element. A simple geometric argument shows these grids can talk.
			</ul>
		<li> The question of whether mapping class groups of mixing SFTs are sofic is not solvable at present.
			<ul>
			<li> Soficity of MCG is asked in: <a href="#BoCh18">[Boyle-Chuysurichay, 2018]</a>
			<li> Our reduction in: <a href="#Sa21a">[Salo, 2021a]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: Embed Thompson's \(V\). For this, biject dyadic rationals with finite words, have \(V\) act on them naturally. Perform this action between two markers.
			</ul>
		<li> Every right-angled Artin group embeds in the Brin-Thompson \(2V\).
			<ul>
			<li> Contrary conjectured in: <a href="#BeBlMa20">[Belk-Bleak-Matucci, 2020]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa21">[Salo, 2021]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: Conveyor belts.
			</ul>
		<li> The seeded tiling problem on the lamplighter group is undecidable.
			<ul>
			<li> Mentioned as open in a public research statement of Sebastián Barbieri. He did not remember asking it when I told him about the result, but I'm counting it anyway!
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#BaSa20">[Bartholdi-Salo, 2020] </a>
			<li> Proof idea: Construct an SFT where every seeded configuration contains a gadget inside which a finite-state machine can interpret a grid. We construct two (geometrically rather different) such SFTs, the "comb" and the "sealevel".
			<li> (Outdated by the result of <a href="#BaSa24">[Bartholdi-Salo, 2024]</a>.)
			</ul>
		<li> Conjugacy of reversible cellular automata is undecidable.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#JaKa20">[Jalonen-Kari, 2020]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa20a">[Salo, 2020a]</a>
			</ul>
		<li> Not all horoballs of finitely-generated groups are Busemann.
			<ul>

			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa20">[Salo, 2020]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: I calculated these for lamplighter and Heisenberg, and both gave examples.
			</ul>
		<li> Two-dimensional Turing machines can be topologically mixing in TMH.
			<ul>
			<li> We do not know if this question appears in the literature, but this was an open problem according to Anahí Gajardo.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaTo20">[Salo-Törmä, 2020]</a>
			</ul>
		<li> Finite-support Gardens of Eden for Game of Life are a decidable set.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: Oscar Cunningham's answer to Dominik van der Zypen's question in MO <a href="#ZyCu19">[van der Zypen-Cunningham, 2019]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaTo19">[Salo-Törmä, 2019]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: Reduce an extension problem to one about finite-state machines, solve by computer.
			</ul>
		<li> Any ordinal can be realized as the CPE rank on a one-dimensional subshift.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in private communication by Nishant Chandgotia.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa19b">[Salo, 2019a] </a>
			<li> Westrick proves the analog for \(\mathbb{Z}^2\)-SFTs  (confirming my conjecture from <a href="#Sa19b">[Salo, 2019a]</a>).
			</ul>
		<li> Polygonal SFTs are not closed under conjugacy.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in <a href="#FrKr20">[Franks-Kra, 2020]</a>; Pierre Guillon essentially asked it in a talk.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa19a">[Salo, 2019a] </a>
			<li> Proof idea: Just recode Ledrappier, you can't fail.
			</ul>
		<li> ECA 57 is a universal reversible logical gate.
			<ul>
			<li> Conjectured in: <a href="#MaMcMo11">[Macauley-McCammond-Mortveit, 2011]</a> and essentially in <a href="#Vi12">[Vielhaber, 2012]</a>.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa18a">[Salo, 2018a]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: Construct the NOT gate by computer, then it's easy to find an existing universal gate set.
			<li> Note: The Toffoli gate seems beyond computer reach, so I don't have a human-free proof of the result. Probably could be done in GAP.
			</ul>
		<li> Minimal subshifts can have the language pivot property.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked by Michael Hochman in the conference Current Trends in Dynamical Systems and the Mathematical Legacy of Rufus Bowen, organized in Vancouver in 2017.
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa18">[Salo, 2019]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: Just do it / subshift construction from word concatenation.
			</ul>
		<li> Settled the 11 remaining cases of Von Neumann regularity of elementary cellular automata.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#CaGa20">[Castillo-Ramirez-Gadouleau, 2020]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa18">[Salo, 2018]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: A more general decision algorithm is given in <a href="#SaTo15">[Salo-Törmä, 2015]</a>, I just applied it. The algorithm is based on a periodics/aperiodics argument (like the proof of the Embedding Theorem for SFTs).
			</ul>
		<li> Quasiminimal subshifts can be trace universal.
			<ul>
			<li> Conjectured false in: <a href="#DeKuBl06">[Delvenne-Kůrka-Blondel, 2006]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa17a">[Salo, 2017a]</a>

			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#KaTa15">[Kari-Taati, 2015]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#HeSaTh20">[Hellouin de Menibus-Salo-Theyssier, 2020] </a>
			</ul>
		<li> One-dimensional CA can be physically universal
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in <a href="#Sc14">[Schaeffer, 2014]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaTo17">[Salo-Törmä, 2017]</a>
			<li> Related: A physically universal Turing machine exists in two dimensions <a href="#SaTo20">[Salo-Törmä, 2020]</a>.
			<li> Proof idea: Just do Schaeffer's construction in one dimension, replacing directions by speeds. A funny detail, we replace exact geometric positioning of gadgets by a counting argument showing possible positions exist.
			</ul>
		<li> Range/radius distortion is possible in the automorphism group of full shift.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#CyFrKr16">[Cyr-Franks-Kra, 2016]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#GuSa17">[Guillon-Salo, 2017]</a>
			<li> Proof idea: Take any distorted reversible Turing machine (many are known) and simulate it in any way by a reversible cellular automaton (at least two ways are known).
			</ul>
		<li> Majority network prediction is PSPACE-complete.
			<ul>
			<li> Conjectured in: <a href="#GoMo14">[Goles-Montealegre, 2014]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#GoMoSaTo16">[Goles-Montealegre-Salo-Törmä, 2016]</a>
			<li> Note: We reduce the "Iterated Monotone Boolean Circuit" problem. Of course the proof that this characterizes PSPACE is basic CS, but we seem to have inspired <a href="#AbAtCiMaTo18">[Abdulla-Atig-Ciobanu-Mayr-Totzke, 2018]</a>, <a href="#Ci19">[Ciobanu, 2019]</a>, <a href="#AlLePa20">[Almanza-Leucci-Panconesi, 2020]</a> which use our problem.
			</ul>
		<li> Minimal subshifts need not have f.g. automorphism group.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#DoDuMaPe16">[Donoso-Durand-Maass-Petite, 2016]</a>
			<li> Previous solutions: <a href="#BoLiRu88">[Boyle-Lind-Rudolph, 1988]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa17">[Salo, 2017] </a>
			<li> Note: I calculated the automorphism groups of some "Toeplitz substitutions" (in the hole sense) out of general interest, this class was advertised to me by Luca Zamboni. Some of the simplest possible are not f.g. so I wrote this up.
			</ul>
		<li> Chaotic reversible CA can be trace universal.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#DeKuBl06">[Delvenne-Kůrka-Blondel, 2006]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#KaSato14">[Kari-Salo-Törmä, 2014]</a>

			<li> Asked in: <a href="#MoBo97">[Moore-Boykett, 1997]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaTo13a">[Salo-Törmä, 2013a]</a>

			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#BaDuJe08">[Ballier-Durand-Jeandel, 2008]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaTo13">[Salo-Törmä, 2013]</a>
			<li> Extensions: Törmä constructed a large class of posets in this thesis <a href="#To15">[Törmä, 2015]</a>
			</ul>
		<li> Higher-dimensional CA are nilrigid.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#GuRi08">[Guillon-Richard, 2008]</a>
			<li> Repeated in: <a href="#GuRi10">[Guillon-Richard, 2010]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#Sa12">[Salo, 2012]</a>
			<li> Extensions: CA on residually finite solvable groups <a href="#SaTo20a">[Salo-Törmä, 2020a]</a> and CA on trees <a href="#Sa19c">[Salo, 2019c]</a> are nilrigid.
			</ul>
		<li> Cantor-Bendixson ranks of countable SFTs can be infinite
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#BaDuJe08">[Ballier-Durand-Jeandel, 2008]</a>
			<li> First solved in: <a href="#JeVa11">[Jeandel-Vanier, 2011]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaTo12a">[Salo-Törmä, 2012a] </a>, <a href="#SaTo13">[Salo-Törmä, 2013]</a>
			<li> The set of CB-ranks is now known: better and better upper bounds are given in <a href="#JeVa11">[Jeandel-Vanier, 2011]</a>, <a href="#SaTo13">[Salo-Törmä, 2013]</a>, <a href="#To15">[Törmä, 2015]</a>, <a href="#To18">[Törmä, 2018]</a>, and the last reaches the lower bound in <a href="#BaJe13">[Ballier-Jeandel, 2013]</a>.
			</ul>
		<li> There is no CA on a full shift which is transitive in the Besicovitch topology.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked by: <a href="#Ma98">[Manzini, 1998]</a>
			<li> First solved in: <a href="#BlCeFo03">[Blanchard-Cervelle-Formenti, 2003]</a>
			<li> Our solution in: <a href="#SaTo12">[Salo-Törmä, 2012]</a>
			<li> Note: Based on measure theory. To my knowledge not obviously equivalent to the Kolmogorov complexity theoretic proof.
			</ul>
		<li> There is a shift-invariant nonatomic measure on the full shift with the Besicovitch topology.
			<ul>
			<li> Asked in: <a href="#GaFoMaMa97">[Gattaneo-Formenti-Margara-Mazoyer, 1997]</a>

			<ul>
			<li> Originally asked in: <a href="#Ro78">[Rosenfeld, 1978]</a>
			<li> Repeated in: <a href="#KaMo01">[Kari-Moore, 2001]</a> and <a href="#LiMoNo98">[Lindgren-Moore-Nordahl, 1998]</a>

	<p>
	<sup>1</sup> More precisely, this is a partial (and possibly total) list of problems that were asked by someone other than me, and I am on the author list of a publically available paper/preprint where this question is solved, or (in at least one case) reduced to other better-known problems. In most cases I believe I was essentially involved in solving the problem, but in some cases I was somewhat useless (at least in the parts of the paper related to the specific problem) and this is clarified in a comment. Not all the solutions have been peer-reviewed (at least officially). Most of these questions were asked in a public forum in writing, a few I just heard privately. Some were not first solved by me, and if I know a previous reference I give it. In some cases our "solution" just points out a (not necessarily, but possibly, obvious) connection between existing results, and this has been clarified. In some cases I have also included some additional information and related open problems (but with no particular consistency). If I immediately see a one- or two-sentence summary of the proof, I give it. I have aimed for completeness rather than only included "important" results, indeed I found it best to keep evaluation of the comparative difficulty and interestingness to a minimum (whether a one sentence summary exists is not an indication of this). These are roughly in ascending order by age.
